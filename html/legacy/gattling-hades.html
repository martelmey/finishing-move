Caressed by Hades,<br>
lead astray by my impulse<br>
The crack of doom my fascination,<br>
the crossing of the Styx my determination<br>
I cannot conceal my manipulative desire,<br>
conversing with the crippling scaffold<br>

The allure of the slipknot<br>
tantalizes my thoughts<br>
A jolt, a resentment,<br>
I cannot surpass the Lethe<br>
The great division has set<br>
my heart aflame once more<br>

An arousing adventure,<br>
the western eyes promote the commitment<br>
and advertise the clean air<br>
The wretch within,<br>
dominated by the passion,<br>
cannot mask the lust for an echo<br>
Harping on the host and<br>
gambling on the age, we carry on<br>

Enticed by the wheel’s motion,<br>
programmed by her widom’s fantasy, I must reveal<br>
My feral deer is energized<br>
by the termination, the threads fall loose<br>
Taken up my cross, taken my punishment,<br>
debating the consequence<br>

I am a mere fool, the fault in justice,<br>
the gray area in compromise<br>
My timetable caught up<br>
in infinity’s laughter,<br>
I must speak with my master now<br>
I embrace my magnificent flaw,<br>
and fall out from underneath<br>

Melting into the furniture,<br>
slipping away from purpose<br>

cultured a reason<br>
My innocence spiting my guilt,<br>
again I have broken her promise<br>

Isolated in the past tense,<br>
breathing for the uncertainty<br>
The hell fawn that is my soul,<br>
to death I have been betrothed<br>
Tied into his royalty,<br>
admiring the peak of my nonsense<br>

Wielding this blasphemous anger,<br>
again I have slandered my birthright<br>
A fate depicted in blood, on the floor,<br>
in my mind, bleeding from this wound<br>
Trusting in this vexing intelligence,<br>
will the doorbell chime to my death?<br>
