                    <td>
Caressed by Hades, lead astray by my impulse<br>
The crack of doom my fascination, the crossing of the Styx my determination<br>
I cannot conceal my manipulative desire, conversing with the crippling scaffold<br>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                                <tr>
                    <td>
The allure of the slipknot tantalizes my thoughts<br>
A jolt, a resentment, I cannot surpass the Lethe<br>
The great division has set my heart aflame once more<br>
                    </td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>
An arousing adventure, the western eyes promote the commitment and advertise the clean air<br>
The wretch within, dominated by the passion, cannot mask the lust for an echo<br>
Harping on the host and gambling on the age, we carry on<br>

                    <td>
Enticed by the wheel’s motion, programmed by her widom’s fantasy, I must reveal<br>
My feral deer is energized by the termination, the threads fall loose<br>
Taken up my cross, taken my punishment, debating the consequence<br>
                    </td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>
I am a mere fool, the fault in justice, the gray area in compromise<br>
My timetable caught up in infinity’s laughter, I must speak with my master now<br>
I embrace my magnificent flaw, and fall out from underneath<br>
                    </td>

                <tr>
                    <td>
Melting into the furniture, slipping away from purpose<br>
Imagine if I would, I knew my name, cultured a reason<br>
My innocence spiting my guilt, again I have broken her promise<br>
                    </td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>
Isolated in the past tense, breathing for the uncertainty<br>
The hell fawn that is my soul, to death I have been betrothed<br>
Tied into his royalty, admiring the peak of my nonsense<br>
                    </td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>
Wielding this blasphemous anger, again I have slandered my birthright<br>
A fate depicted in blood, on the floor, in my mind, bleeding from this wound<br>
Trusting in this vexing intelligence, will the doorbell chime to my death?<br>
                    </td>

                <tr>
                    <td>
You were my promenade, Gattling Hades, straight forth and cunning<br>
The date is burning a hole in my fury’s containment<br>
