But from nothing's juncture with everything,<br>
where-from the first word was whispered<br>
by the orchestrated tears in time,<br>
resounding apart by lightyears,<br>
over the unamde and endless acres<br>
here that found their space -<br>
she was put in where every reprise<br>
of hers would suffer.<br>
Where the few and far between<br>
of her sisters in makeup,<br>
scattered like that across the land,<br>

the hush this day and age smothered them.<br>

Those were the words<br>
she wrote at once upon getting home,<br>
following the rain, blight and injury<br>
she sustained by the way's prescription,<br>
in an aftermath of that<br>
and the harrowed hours preceding,<br>
detailing the thousandth power<br>
her heart took of one event's few<br>
but growing recitals.<br>
Each additional place afforded<br>
to intensity for multiplication,<br>
reflected each new fracture in a mosaic<br>
sprawling her self's sheerest minimum.<br>
A whole - once, I'd been -<br>
had bent in recent years as saplings do,<br>
to grow 'round frustration,<br>
it's cracking, division's product -<br>

subtraction's force<br>
from her heart's integrity.<br>

Yet in that same sliver of time<br>
she sat draped over her desk<br>
in the kerosene gleam that lit her room,<br>
whereon had settled<br>
a solemn tone of dusk,<br>
which struck the curtain's she'd drawn<br>
on entry, to diffuse the waning herald<br>
of the south-slipping sun<br>
out across the windowpane's hug of walls -<br>
might her instance have writhed alone<br>
in space and time, but not at all<br>
in transposition, where in each place<br>
could undergo translation as do tongues,<br>
and put her by result into<br>
some standard mid-western bedroom,<br>
by more than one hundred years elapsed,<br>
craned over paper and clutching ink,<br>
to lament in strongest silence<br>
the precisely-same, pained notion -<br>
by that younger decade's rendition.<br>

"I can't feel it -<br>
the harmony plucked with discord<br>
from all angles of the shape taken<br>
and immune to tracing,<br>
by the hypocrisy of drawing lines<br>
on the spawn of chaos, our consciousness -<br>
though in absence of birth,<br>
I shalt never die -<br>
I'm lent indifferent from all others,<br>
the vibration my colours cast<br>
on finding resonance,<br>
no matter the weight with distance,<br>
it may stand to crush the founder -<br>
on the outskirts of sense,<br>
my solitude's dissolved<br>
by the closeness but here that's made,<br>

of my spirit's even distant relative."<br>

Words as hers were scratched<br>
in code over a dense volume's series,<br>
kept and abridging decades,<br>
ending only with the chariot to her soul's<br>
finaly cycle of breath and blood.<br>
Enduring twice her lifetime,<br>
put by her nervous family<br>
behind the estate's walls,<br>
stood as a temple to their name -<br>
someone having trickled down<br>
to some tertiary branch,<br>
on the whole's fringe of extinction<br>
on the next century's turn,<br>
found and with them, enough resonance<br>
to print them for my bookshelf's holding,<br>
200 years later.<br>
