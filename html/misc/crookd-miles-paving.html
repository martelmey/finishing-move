					when all the phone's've gone out<br>
on a crooked mile's paving's eve<br>
no coin's spared for these breeches<br>
on aging's rumbling rails<br>
sprawling in rural cloisters<br>
beneath my feet, sound found its simile<br>
and my back an impact of rock,<br>
once I'd sprung off and eyed the tracks<br>
shy a minute's span of distance<br>
where suns for eyes were attached<br>
thereto the tonne-weighing bullet<br>
seeming to swallow time much faster,<br>
barreled by and cut it in two<br>
displacing the hundredfold<br>
of fractured bits of me,<br>
that'd already past through<br>
our author's pen, if any to be<br>
absconded before being bled<br>
onto and through that page,<br>
like any other live's blotting out<br>
seeping although indefinitely<br>
into each one following, until<br>
the back cover's touched<br>
and snuffs it out<br>

glisten under rain<br>
and twisted tin cans are strewn<br>
amidst forsaken tools to consume<br>
sinister foliage, and its scraps<br>
within woods thickly brandished<br>
with sword ferns and needles<br>
furnished in the dankest dark<br>
lain into home for all mosses,<br>
spiders and anthropods<br>
somberly still beneath graying rapids<br>
in the skyward expanse which shifts<br>
with clouds like earthly plates,<br>
coursing devoid of place nor purpose<br>
and putting all of land in ponderance<br>
for what moves and even speaks,<br>
in the thickets that our hustling<br>
and bustling throws up, like walls<br>
or simply in its besetting haze,<br>
the opaqueness over our eyes it glossses<br>

pervading kitchens and bathrooms,<br>

all those factors alone unchanged<br>
for decades spent assailed in soot<br>
scattered off a fortune's cigarettes<br>
in-between and overlapping<br>
the spots where toxins missed the mouth<br>
in their vessels' tossings backward<br>
more populous near the lazyboy,<br>
while the porch's long scorched-through<br>
sleep there and swear by<br>
the termites in your dreams,<br>

classic rock rebounds off the brick,<br>
gas cans and steel in a man's cave<br>
patrolled by dogs whose names brand<br>
a dozen citations daylight's not seen<br>

offset with defaulting muscle mass<br>
but reinforced by the face<br>
he'd apparantly chiseled from rock<br>
draped in the plainest clothes<br>
far-gone and over-spun for his rack<br>
of jagged calcium for a frame<br>
seething chemicals wracked their havoc<br>
amidst a mind severed from gravity<br>
in an unfinished home's apex,<br>
far enough from the scroll saws<br>
humming and shrieking from below<br>
the surface's humble threshold<br>
trumped in decibels by the speakers<br>
he'd kicked in and enhanced,<br>
for rage's transliteration<br>
from the fist's heat unto waves<br>
modeled for a chord's voicing<br>
those that're overdriven and searing<br>
straight off of jittering steel strings<br>

decked in the military's issue<br>
of woolen throws, and that of<br>
a long-gone grandma's sewn-up squares<br>
and if it were a stage for the overture<br>
he'd take in deepening solace for<br>
the solitude romancing him,<br>
then those curtains to the window<br>
widely opened, just feet away<br>
gave him a mountain range's audience<br>
capped all along in glaring ice,<br>
piercing a dull-blue vacuum and<br>
unfolding foothills in fathoms<br>
rolling with autumn's particular tone<br>
of jade and sand, for every hectare<br>
betwixt thence and one of several<br>
few-and-far-apart residences,<br>
and they both were alone<br>
to behold for one, the other's<br>
indefinite pause in feeling,<br>
and consequential leaning<br>
for the gritty, motorized,<br>
and gas-powered of avenues<br>
for time's spiting passage and<br>
that taken from trench to trench<br>
whereby his visit inlays the story<br>
to be another floor in his house<br>
delusion's inset his father<br>

over a glazing set of eyes,<br>
splayed behind the wall of sleep<br>
and the background's radiation<br>
wrapped in transparent noise<br>
dizzying and annulling all lines<br>
then confusing all law's borders<br>
allowing a walk through all solids,<br>
wherein he'd dabbled enough yet<br>
in the thralls of waking's prescription<br>
laid out thus in life's description<br>
to dullen his body's difference<br>
in aversion to its dying and going<br>

funnelled me through to the desert<br>
of life and timber in his backyard<br>
without need of visiting, or so much<br>
as consciously considering it,<br>
although alone in subliminal scale<br>
of Richter's waves I let through me<br>
transposed that spirit from its<br>
container, a sliver in time<br>
where he'd respired and committed<br>
his last of forlorn thoughts for<br>
the distance he ogled daily<br>
through that window, just feet away<br>
from the bed becoming his final<br>
of resting places, once the doses<br>
proved fatal and subdued him.<br>
