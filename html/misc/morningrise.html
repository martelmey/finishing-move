					There’s faith again, knocking afresh<br>
and opening up, with its breath<br>
fragile windowpanes, dry with ice<br>
silently, in oversized flakes<br>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
					As if from sleep, she stirred in place<br>
her thinning skin grazed the fabric<br>
of a couch she knew, then didn’t<br>
like that second had wiped her mind<br>
					</td>

					With a withered body, decked in<br>
silk, all strategically torn<br>
as if by hands, in a struggle<br>
although alone was all she seemed<br>
					</td>

					Phantasms, she must’ve spoke to<br>
in a prior dream, that left her<br>
certain to detect company,<br>
a’gathered with her, in this room<br>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
					Replete with shag, wood-panelled walls,<br>
twig-legged furnishings, a turn-table,<br>
and in somber tones, a<br>
modern space; by her own recollection<br>
					</td>
				</tr>

					<td>
					A white-washed sky’s foreboding light<br>
flooded softly into the house,<br>
by the ceiling’s copious glass<br>
all at once, this world seemed stifled<br>

				<tr>
					<td>
					Incessent, the sound wouldn’t quit<br>
rap-a-tap-tap on that window,<br>
urgently, above where she laid<br>
but no-one was all she saw there<br>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
					Without this being home she knew<br>
her way, somehow, to the back door<br>
and that she had to get outside<br>
for some arousing, unnamed fear<br>

					<td>
					There's no acclimating to this<br>
threshold of tension in the air,<br>
moss and loam coursed their cold through her<br>
in a vacuous prairie's wake<br>

					A'sway on sobriety's cusp<br>
she stammered with her feet to find<br>
any semblance of who'd left<br>
her behind, in this hurricane's eye<br>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
					On the bank of a hurried stream<br>
a'run underneath the temple<br>
built on a bridge, she'd come out from<br>
her pupils set in glass, peered down<br>
					</td>

				<tr>
					<td>
					Roses, lilacs, magnolias<br>
all manner of tender species<br>
softly wept their petals into<br>
its cutting rush across the land<br>
					</td>

				<tr>
					<td>
					Its rapids throbbing back and forth<br>
in this half-light, stuttering in<br>
successive lines from gray to black<br>
humming static's subtle rattle<br>

					Twisting through unassuming hills,<br>
over to pandemonium's effigy<br>
above the mantle wrought<br>
from cobble, soap and marble<br>
					</td>

				<tr>
					<td>
					Overrun as it was in vines,<br>
shrubs, juniper and fireweed<br>
finding welcome in each crevice<br>
yet it scraped the sky's higher space<br>
					</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td>
					Thereat's where the hand of God thrust<br>
and imploded this sleeping world<br>
dismantling centuries' worth of mist<br>
and inducted me to the end <br>
					</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td>
					Voicelessly flooding the heavens<br>
in the body of ten cores' heat,<br>
like the sun had spilt out in space<br>
before hardening, then raining<br>
					</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td>
					Blackened magma oozed as if from wounds,<br>
and hissed their way down to earth<br>
overcasting an abrasive haze,<br>
in-and-out of everything<br>
					</td>

				<tr>
					<td>
					And then a'ringing plunged my ears<br>
like an external tinnitus,<br>
and only wave's transliteration<br>
into shapes, were left in sight<br>
					</td>

					<td>
					Back inside's where she might've fled<br>
although forbidden, recalling<br>
that she'd lived this day already<br>
and would wake on that couch again.<br>
