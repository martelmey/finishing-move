					I've clocked the tenth click over<br>
In the wrong lane, heretofore;<br>
And another eleven miles more<br>
I'm hoping gets me anywhere<br>
That's even partway to somewhere<br>

					Here's lain in cement, the legacy<br>
That's underlined our harsh reality<br>
A fatal cutting across the land, offset<br>
By the company you've come to regret<br>

					Having shared with me, on the high road<br>
And like ache struggling is shown<br>
Knife's at my back; and we embrace<br>
Stoked shame has it out to erase me<br>
					</td>

					Southerning, the sun is displaced<br>
In crimson columns lancing through us<br>
Thrown over irradiated pavement<br>
Frowned over our roadside placement<br>
					</td>

				<tr>
					<td>
					Wrecked with hands at gravity's mercy<br>
No effort's gonna reimburse me<br>
For the words I've wasted on everyone<br>
And ought to join us here like carrion<br>
					</td>

				<tr>
					<td>
					Stirring an attraction for the surreal<br>
And setting summer's dregs reveal<br>
What’s cropped up in between us<br>
The hour fell and brought harsher to sight<br>
Our decision we never made that night.<br>
