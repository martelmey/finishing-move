					The 0300 Mall's exterior<br>
Is of a foreboding sort of dreary;<br>
Being comprised of cement<br>
That's overtaken<br>
In nature's aging advance.<br>
The locale's smack-dab<br>
In a paradise for the recluse.<br>
There sat a structure,<br>
Retched out from the seventies.<br>
A haunting reminder, if not<br>
Akron's own Rolling Acres.<br>
					</td>

				<tr>
					<td>
					Grass of triple-A-grade trimming -<br>
The sort presidents putted on -<br>
Encompassed the facility,<br>
Enclosed further<br>
In unbroken fathoms<br>
In miles of darkened forest.<br>
Underneath concrete awnings<br>
That are draped in lichen,<br>
Rusting tones of cobblestone<br>
Sprawl over every vagrant<br>
Flower's effort, to meet the sun.<br>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
					Wedged in the thrall<br>
Of first light's promise,<br>
You'll find a state of dawn<br>
That's impeccable, in an<br>
Inability to progress.<br>
Stalemate's overcast implanted<br>
This desaturation of mine,<br>
Out-laying this world I swallowed,<br>
Strictly in black and white,<br>
Once-upon my eyes were useless<br>
In identifying me.<br>
Thus the first and purest strain<br>
Of colourblindness, was mine.<br>
					</td>
				</tr>
				
				<tr>
					<td>
					Therein an unmoving woodland,<br>
The mall lied, underneath<br>
Daylight's ongoing display<br>
Of noon, wherever<br>
The clock's hand may lie.<br>
Perilous, it made the mall -<br>
That would come a'killing down,<br>
Upon anyone inside,<br>
With a sudden dirge of nature<br>
To let it melt, at 0300 sharp<br>
Each morning.<br>
Gladly, folk were swept away<br>
With the ungodly thaw,<br>
To come back washed-up<br>
Happily, later.<br>
