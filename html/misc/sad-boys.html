					We’re the aesthetic’s apostles,<br>
And analgesic slaves, alike<br>
Happily burnt out at the stake<br>
And all for silken ashes' sake;<br>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
					Drippin' heavy with the cure's poison,<br>
Double-stuffed in treason, and<br>
pissed-up in decay's glamour,<br>
lie dead together in their splendour<br>
					</td>

					<td>
					Broke his heart, and turnt into the bad guy<br>
No regrets - being picturesque,<br>
To take a rapturous rest<br>
Underneath a pastel sky<br>
					</td>
				</tr>

					<td>
					Like Canada Post, dawn strikes<br>
Maniacal irony coined the meaning<br>
Derived from substance's intervening<br>
Grief scatters once the price hikes<br>
					</td>

					Remanufactured into tripe<br>
Plant a kiss on it,<br>
and take a sip from it;<br>
that same chalice brimmed with blight<br>
					</td>

				<tr>
					<td>
					Here's where youth's nation sprawls<br>
like grandma's tackiest walls, all the same<br>
Peeling and flaking at the seams<br>
dreaming in a dozen drunken regimes<br>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
					Furthest from Earth and near to the stars<br>
Ensnared in a memoir's stupor,<br>
and amongst us, unreachable;<br>
only in God's court, impeachable<br>

					Decked-up in dry ice's fumes<br>
enchanted and enchained<br>
by all mundane estrangement,<br>
that're the most raptly suffused<br>

					Thereover runs his wasted hands,<br>
fibers that someday must fray<br>
that no peace, at any bottom, could allay<br>
alone, fate's witness understands<br>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
					On his way back up, with a fistful<br>
of the same-old, lethal dose of relief<br>
with survival on the fringe of belief,<br>
escape from shame's purely disdainful<br>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
					Embrace of the superficial,<br>
and savouring of initial sorrow;<br>
Better bet, it's the same one<br>
That could be the last meal of anyone<br>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
					In a bargain-bin, lain to rest<br>
In a dingy, old corner-store, invested<br>
shrink-wrapped and impressed<br>
in wait, for the next of tragedy's blessed<br>
