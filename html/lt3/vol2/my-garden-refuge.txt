gentle lady,
burrow your eyes
in mine;
how so
soft a tidal wave,
you are;
i await
of you,
to move;
i imbibe
the total scent
of you;
it's okay,
this moment -
and safe;
i'm ready to
let what is yours of
mine, be so;
and allow
my garden, refuge in
your very wish;
---
Let loose
My lust upon
Your weathered
Gorgeous form;
too long
naturally
desperately
woven far thru
and in-between,
us,
for this.
Deeplyâ€™s my
yearning for
you, thence until
let go
my empty soul.
