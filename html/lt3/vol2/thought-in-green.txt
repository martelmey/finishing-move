my feelings,
in water,
this instant -
calmly,
swirling,
tucked as a
pool into a
nook'd bank -
otherwise, of
a river flowing
fast - stages
leaves, on its
surface, slowly
spiralling.

dappled, bright
green, there
shows - like
the scattered
sunlight of a
sparsely-stood
wood - of birches,
their flittering
leaves bathed in
summer's green.

and into it,
pulls me, for
just a moment
more, before
we drift apart;
