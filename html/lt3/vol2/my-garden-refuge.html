        <p>
            gentle lady,
            burrow your eyes
            in mine;
            how so
            soft a tidal wave,
            you are;
            i await
            of you,
            to move;
            i imbibe
            the total scent
            of you;
            it's okay,
            this moment -
            and safe;
            i'm ready to
            let what is yours of
            mine, be so;
            and allow
            my garden, refuge in
            your very wish;
            ---
            Let loose
            My lust upon
            Your weathered
            Gorgeous form;
            too long
            naturally
            desperately
            woven far thru
            and in-between,
            us,
            for this.
            Deeplyâ€™s my
            yearning for
            you, thence until
            let go
            my empty soul.
        </p>
