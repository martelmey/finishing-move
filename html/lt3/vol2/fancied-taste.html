        <p>
            before
            you bleed, i'll
            have unveiled
            my skin;
            
            warm,
            is the
            moontide,
            you shed;
            
            with baited
            breath, i
            await,
            underneath;
            
            even if
            you fancied
            for me
            to taste;
            
            waning
            into darkness,
            at last,
            it runs;
            
            the same
            breath of
            relief,
            i share;
            
            sequestered
            into quiet
            nights,
            your words;
            
            together,
            there into,
            i go,
            with you;
            
            and in this
            still, body
            of night,
            suspends;
            
            for once,
            the wear
            and tear,
            of our days;
            
            and that
            same, deep
            pitch, on me
            i yearn to see;
        </p>
