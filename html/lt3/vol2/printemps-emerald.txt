you're immediate,
presiding;
you've passed thru
what i knew as me;

the line defining
me, and the world;
and therein lies
an emerald spring;

the still life of a
wild, unbound:
whereon no mercy,
bestows the sun:

sprawls an acre's
span of gentle turf:
in its midst: a
sycamore's stump;

and slouched on it
peers up my heart;
I feel with you
A part of me,

Becoming us.
what i taste,
distinctly, aspen -
The balsam kind.

right now,
a calm swirling pool
involves my feelings,
into the

nook, of otherwise
a dashing river,
on its surface,
spiralling slowly;

your heart
underneath the waves,
mottles my mind's eye
in dappled green;

meet with me -
once us each
have cleared
these halls -

into the room
cast in blue,
its deepest hue;
where without

windows, one
lone sunflower
fitfully stands,
heralding,
all which we are
due to make.
