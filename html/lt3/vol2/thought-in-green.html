        <p>
            my feelings,
            in water,
            this instant -
            calmly,
            swirling,
            tucked as a
            pool into a
            nook'd bank -
            otherwise, of
            a river flowing
            fast - stages
            leaves, on its
            surface, slowly
            spiralling.
            
            dappled, bright
            green, there
            shows - like
            the scattered
            sunlight of a
            sparsely-stood
            wood - of birches,
            their flittering
            leaves bathed in
            summer's green.
            
            and into it,
            pulls me, for
            just a moment
            more, before
            we drift apart;
