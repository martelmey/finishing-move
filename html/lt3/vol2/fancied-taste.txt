before
you bleed, i'll
have unveiled
my skin;

warm,
is the
moontide,
you shed;

with baited
breath, i
await,
underneath;

even if
you fancied
for me
to taste;

waning
into darkness,
at last,
it runs;

the same
breath of
relief,
i share;

sequestered
into quiet
nights,
your words;

together,
there into,
i go,
with you;

and in this
still, body
of night,
suspends;

for once,
the wear
and tear,
of our days;

and that
same, deep
pitch, on me
i yearn to see;
