        <h1>FM Inc. / LT3 / Vol. 2/ Printemps Emerald</h1>
        <p>
            you're immediate,
            presiding;
            you've passed thru
            what i knew as me;
            
            the line defining
            me, and the world;
            and therein lies
            an emerald spring;
            
            the still life of a
            wild, unbound:
            whereon no mercy,
            bestows the sun:
            
            sprawls an acre's
            span of gentle turf:
            in its midst: a
            sycamore's stump;
            
            and slouched on it
            peers up my heart;
            I feel with you
            A part of me,
            
            Becoming us.
            what i taste,
            distinctly, aspen -
            The balsam kind.
            
            right now,
            a calm swirling pool
            involves my feelings,
            into the
            
            nook, of otherwise
            a dashing river,
            on its surface,
            spiralling slowly;
            
            your heart
            underneath the waves,
            mottles my mind's eye
            in dappled green;
            
            meet with me -
            once us each
            have cleared
            these halls -
            
            into the room
            cast in blue,
            its deepest hue;
            where without
            
            windows, one
            lone sunflower
            fitfully stands,
            heralding,
            all which we are
            due to make.
