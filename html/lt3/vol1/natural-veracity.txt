When I think about being yours,
I don't recall since when I last felt
as wracked as this,
with my nature's
truest fervour.

Unfettered, I would've loosened
my voice, if it were but us alone;
with ease through me,
not like this, have
ever I shook.

there's emotion's  salve - in your eyes,
and your name on my lips elicits
the deepest pull
ever I've felt,
from the inside.
