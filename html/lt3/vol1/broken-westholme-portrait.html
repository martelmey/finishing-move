        <h1>FM Inc. / LT3 / Vol. 1 / Broken Westholme Portrait</h1>
        <p>
            i'm inevitable
            to see, with searching attention
            and compassion,
            like the still unhurried wind,
            abiding just as deeply
            
            i'm partaken
            as thoroughly, as the wine
            i've turnt from water
            underneath my grasp,
            knit with pain and
            revelry, alike
            
            i'm unchained
            in the palette spanning hours
            of feeling, i've wrought
            of the image, unfolding
            along my spine
            
            i'm occupied
            with your patience,
            an unraveled nature,
            which up and down, climbed the walls
            
            i'm enormous
            not in the world, but in what
            i reveal
        </p>
