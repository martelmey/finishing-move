into the far
bosom of night,
into succinct
magnitudes, close -

the moon deepest
into, crawling,
engulfed our
furthest verges.

just a drop, the
normal sort of
love comprises
of this ocean,

and coalesced
in the gathered
tide, unloosened
endless, tonight.

and gingerly
the world anew
spiralled off of
a storied shape,

befallen in
and knelt upon
the brim I knew
of us, as yours.
