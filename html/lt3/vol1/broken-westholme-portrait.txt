i'm inevitable
to see, with searching attention
and compassion,
like the still unhurried wind,
abiding just as deeply

i'm partaken
as thoroughly, as the wine
i've turnt from water
underneath my grasp,
knit with pain and
revelry, alike

i'm unchained
in the palette spanning hours
of feeling, i've wrought
of the image, unfolding
along my spine

i'm occupied
with your patience,
an unraveled nature,
which up and down, climbed the walls

i'm enormous
not in the world, but in what
i reveal
