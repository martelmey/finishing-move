i recoup flight's talent,
and reach thru the floor,
to attain the stars' presence.
whisked in an instant towards
the impossible,
where i recall your whisper,
intangible,
in a decade's thousand places.

all of my force, is my will
for you to take,
if you would endure me,
unraveling your catalyst;
the thought alone
of you, i barely can;
much less the spell
your smile has cast.

let's have the night fall,
upon our silence,
and envelope us,
and dissolve thereby,
our differences;
and i as you, to feel a part of me,
is you.
