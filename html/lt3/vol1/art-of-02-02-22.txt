i see you,
i can hear you -
the great one
of dreamy nights;

do you know
what i'm doing?
tell me,
am i welcome?

each step of
my breath, is safe?
unguarded,
you do want it?

drawn for this
song, having sung,
are we changed?
for having begun?

with your heart
in charge, i saw
your eyes speak: 
i am welcome.
