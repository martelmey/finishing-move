Where my key does fit,
you've poured and shaped your heart into
and there now, my total joy debuts

My elysium,
shed over my entirety:
is this biding intensity.

intermittently,
your prowess bridles the precipice,
as my nearness enters evidence.

versus the inverse,
until now has been true:
is it will soon experience me.

and now i'm restrained,
trussed in this tossing volution
as we pursue the conclusion.

now just a vessel,
meant for wracking by our want,
for my complete duration.
