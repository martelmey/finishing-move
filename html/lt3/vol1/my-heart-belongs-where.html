        <h1>FM Inc. / LT3 / Vol. 1 / My Heart Belongs Where</h1>
        <p>
            Where my key does fit,
            you've poured and shaped your heart into
            and there now, my total joy debuts
            
            My elysium,
            shed over my entirety:
            is this biding intensity.
            
            intermittently,
            your prowess bridles the precipice,
            as my nearness enters evidence.
            
            versus the inverse,
            until now has been true:
            is it will soon experience me.
            
            and now i'm restrained,
            trussed in this tossing volution
            as we pursue the conclusion.
            
            now just a vessel,
            meant for wracking by our want,
            for my complete duration.
