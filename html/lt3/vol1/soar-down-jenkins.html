        <p>
            i recoup flight's talent,
            and reach thru the floor,
            to attain the stars' presence.
            whisked in an instant towards
            the impossible,
            where i recall your whisper,
            intangible,
            in a decade's thousand places.
            
            all of my force, is my will
            for you to take,
            if you would endure me,
            unraveling your catalyst;
            the thought alone
            of you, i barely can;
            much less the spell
            your smile has cast.
            
            let's have the night fall,
            upon our silence,
            and envelope us,
            and dissolve thereby,
            our differences;
            and i as you, to feel a part of me,
            is you.
