Last night I
Listened to
Your breath,
Catch,
Release,
and tumble,
Thru your
Disbelief,
And
Bewilderment,
That
This
Could really be
Happening,
To you -
Of all women:
Beneath
This young one,
With reverence
For your beauty
Whispered
From her warm lips;
And then,
You gasp,
And it all -
That youâ€™d held
For years in need,
Escaped you
In tremors,
I captured
From your mouth.
