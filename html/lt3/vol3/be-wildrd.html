         <p>
            Last night I
            Listened to
            Your breath,
            Catch,
            Release,
            and tumble,
            Thru your
            Disbelief,
            And
            Bewilderment,
            That
            This
            Could really be
            Happening,
            To you -
            Of all women:
            Beneath
            This young one,
            With reverence
            For your beauty
            Whispered
            From her warm lips;
            And then,
            You gasp,
            And it all -
            That youâ€™d held
            For years in need,
            Escaped you
            In tremors,
            I captured
            From your mouth.
