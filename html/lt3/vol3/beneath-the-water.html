        <p>
            There’s much to do
            This morning,
            Beneath the water;
            
            Much to do,
            There is,
            As wet as we are;
            
            Your mouth
            I hear, on my
            Neck, by my ear;
            
            Into your skin,
            My aura’s found
            its way, seeped,
            
            Into your skin,
            My entire need
            Is drawn;
            
            My hands, run
            Down your back,
            With the water,
            
            Your hand, cupped
            By my mouth, for
            Entrance: your tongue’s,
            
            Delicate, our
            Wild paving,
            Of these paths
            
            We take, and
            Pursue, doused
            Down upon us;
            
            Hours I hope
            To spend, in chase,
            Of the edge,
            
            Of the very body
            Of us, made up of
            Our very scents,
        </p>
    </body>
