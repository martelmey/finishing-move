Preparing, to ride the wind:
bowed upon her by the sky;
after the beginning, its breath
composed the world,
and the air itself, cradled her
for her year's finale;
their joined descent and rise,
illustrated all of fate;
and then for Love's sake,
were divided - for the chance
of unity.
For having need to reinvent
what bounds at all, might
existence even have;
