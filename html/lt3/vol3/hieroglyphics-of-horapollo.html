            Preparing, to ride the wind:
            bowed upon her by the sky;
            after the beginning, its breath
            composed the world,
            and the air itself, cradled her
            for her year's finale;
            their joined descent and rise,
            illustrated all of fate;
            and then for Love's sake,
            were divided - for the chance
            of unity.
            For having need to reinvent
            what bounds at all, might
            existence even have;
        </p>
