        <h1>FM Inc. / LT3 / Vol. 3 / Into The Quiet, Went</h1>
        <p>
            in the evening:
            the quiet,
            throughout
            the dark,
            restless: my
            soul, until
            your voice:
            breached your
            dreams , and
            my own:
            as a hand:
            taking yours,
            and your words:
            once scattered,
            with a kiss:
            transmuted
            whole, from
            a thousand
            brilliant
            pieces.
