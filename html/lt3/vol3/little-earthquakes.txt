When you cause me to,
it's something so nicely
you've taken from me,
you've caused to grow,
that I'd not elect to stop,
however - you want it,
and with a promise
of more - my restraint's
relinquished, and you
take it, and I enjoy it;
and a'quiver with the
thrill, of my trust in you
having lead my Love
straight into its seat,
like silk, pulled delicate
from my sacred wish.
