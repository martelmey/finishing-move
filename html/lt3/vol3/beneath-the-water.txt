There’s much to do
This morning,
Beneath the water;

Much to do,
There is,
As wet as we are;

Your mouth
I hear, on my
Neck, by my ear;

Into your skin,
My aura’s found
its way, seeped,

Into your skin,
My entire need
Is drawn;

My hands, run
Down your back,
With the water,

Your hand, cupped
By my mouth, for
Entrance: your tongue’s,

Delicate, our
Wild paving,
Of these paths

We take, and
Pursue, doused
Down upon us;

Hours I hope
To spend, in chase,
Of the edge,

Of the very body
Of us, made up of
Our very scents,
