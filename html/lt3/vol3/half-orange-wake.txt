Half asleep,
in her bright orange,
in my body,
two nights ago:
there came love, like
I could melt into you,
Meld into you, or
be breathed in
by you, becoming
every part of you,
enveloped as a seed's
step backwards, as if
we were safe again
together, from life;
and entire, and in
being so, becoming
only more entirely
me.
