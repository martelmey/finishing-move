        <h1>FM Inc. / LT3 / Vol. 3 /  Lady</h1>
        <p>
            lady,
            of the ether -
            of nothing
            but hope -
            one day, you
            came to me;
            
            as had the
            whispers, by
            a distance
            ridiculous,
            divine, and
            pathless;
            
            from out of
            my tiny pocket
            of this world,
            from out of
            its oblivion,
            i'd tilt my gaze;
            
            flung down
            came a tether,
            from your
            loftiest light -
            all this time -
            withstanding.
        </p>
    </body>
