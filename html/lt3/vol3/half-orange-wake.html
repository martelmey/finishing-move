        <h1>FM Inc. / LT3 / Vol. 3 / Half-Orange Wake</h1>
        <p>
            Half asleep,
            in her bright orange,
            in my body,
            two nights ago:
            there came love, like
            I could melt into you,
            Meld into you, or
            be breathed in
            by you, becoming
            every part of you,
            enveloped as a seed's
            step backwards, as if
            we were safe again
            together, from life;
            and entire, and in
            being so, becoming
            only more entirely
            me.
