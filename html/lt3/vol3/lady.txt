lady,
of the ether -
of nothing
but hope -
one day, you
came to me;

as had the
whispers, by
a distance
ridiculous,
divine, and
pathless;

from out of
my tiny pocket
of this world,
from out of
its oblivion,
i'd tilt my gaze;

flung down
came a tether,
from your
loftiest light -
all this time -
withstanding.
