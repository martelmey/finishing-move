        <p>
            it's enormous,
            and everything,
            so scarily.
            
            once you spoke
            of us, entangled
            deep, with
            eyes closed,
            under our
            deeper tide;
            
            nice or not,
            it's always
            been lonely,
            and I never
            knew, you
            could follow
            me here
            
            into the
            part of my
            language,
            that urges
            for unity,
            between mine
            and yours.
            
            somehow, our
            status quo
            in each moment,
            the result
            of us, is
            the happiest
            progression
            
            my hand
            with yours,
            clasping
            the one that's
            caught our fears,
            the chilliest
            current's
            direction,
            in you
            I trust
            
            I behold
            with you
            the mundane,
            exquisite,
            for our passing
            it in tandem
            
            my heart
            I unravel,
            for welcome of
            your pain,
            for love's sake,
            from mine,
            indistinguishable -
            
            as in the pitch
            dark, of our
            waters shifting
            through us,
            each breath
            of ours taken,
            indistinguishable -
            
            the stillness
            in these depths,
            derived of trust
            in the grip
            of doom, reared
            of the pit,
            beyond where
            the ocean's floor
            ought to be -
            
            nigh on
            terrors precipice,
            and at my bedside,
            manifested of
            ethereal fibres,
            plied only far
            past consciousness
            
            translates into
            my life, when
            woven thru
            the storm,
            of mine's eye.
            
            you're bigger
            than you, and
            i'm bigger
            than me, and
            it's as if
            we're overlapped
            
            i do love,
            loving you,
            in the weaving
            of our frayed
            edges,
            together.
